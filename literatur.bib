%%%%% Actual bibliography entries.
%
% Sorted by key. 
%
% When adding new entries, please do not use tabs, but spaces 
% instead. We have the following convention for keys:
% <authors>-<venue>
%
% For authors, if there are only two others, we write out both
% names and connect them with -, if there are three or more,
% we abbreviate firstauthor-et-al.
%
% For books, venue is only the year of publication, for conference
% papers, this is the conference name together with the year, with
% no seperator. For conference workshops, we append ws after the 
% year, possibly together with an abbreaviation.
%
% Examples:
% pommerening-et-al-icaps2014 (conference paper)
% jonas-icaps2012wshsdip (often cited workshop with abbreviation) 
% jonas-aaai2008wssearch (rarely cited workshop without abbreviation) 
% jonas-nips2011ws (single workshop at the conference) 
% russell-norvig-2003 (book)
%
% Please also follow the form of (most) of the existing entries, 
% which is:
%
% @<Type>{<key>,
%   author =       "Authors"
%   title =        "Title"
%   crossref =      "<key-from-crossref.bib-or-crossref-short.bib>"
%   etc.
% }
%
% Especially note that the "=" comes directly after the keyword,
% followed by as many spaces as required so that the actual entries
% start in column 18.

Discusses the complexity of planning in the SAS+ formalism, which is
different from propositional STRIPS in allowing non-binary state
variables. The paper discusses four restrictions to general SAS+
planning (which has the same complexity as propositional STRIPS):

- postuniqueness (P): For each variable/value pair, there is at most
  one operator with this pair as an effect.
- unariness (U): Each operator has only one effect.
- binariness (B): All state variables are binary.
- single-valuedness (S): For all variables, there is a dedicated value
  such that all operators that have a precondition but no effect on
  this variable have that value as a precondition (and not another
  one).

The authors show that restrictions PUS allow optimal planning in
polynomial time and restrictions US allow non-optimal planning in
polynomial time. These are minimal restrictions with these properties
(if P != NP), and they are the only minimal ones. (In some cases, this
is due to hardness proofs, in other cases due to exponential length
shortest plans).

Notes:
* For some problems (those between P and PUB/PBS), complexity of
  plan existence is open, but shortest plans can be exponentially
  long, so this is not so relevant.
* Unariness is related to causal graphs: It is necessary for
  acyclicity. Acyclicity could be studied instead.
* Postuniqueness is related to domain transition graphs: It means that
  the reachable part of each DTG is a directed tree or a cycle.
  Other restrictions on DTG shape could be studied instead (in fact,
  acyclic DTGs have been studied by Bäckström and Jonsson.)
* Single-valuedness could be generalized by requiring a strict or
  non-strict total or partial order among values such that for any two
  values d < d', if there is an operator with precondition v=d', then
  there is a similar operator with precondition v=d. (Think of fuel
  levels.)

  pages =        "1178--1195",
  crossref =     "ijcai97"
}

Discusses a planning model that is related to SAS+ planning (although
there are a few differences motivated by the application domain, which
is reactive control of physical devices). The paper shows that in
unary SAS+-like domains with acyclic causal graphs and reversible
operators (i.e., for each operator that sets v from d to d', there is
an operator with identical preconditions that sets v from d' to d),
incremental planning with polynomial delay is possible. The authors
also note that in acyclic graphs, problems are always easily
serializable (compare Korf's work).

Williams' and Nayak's restrictions are obviously related to SAS+
planning with acyclic causal graphs and strongly connected domain
transition graphs. Reversibility means that DTGs are undirected, so it
is a stronger condition than strong connectedness (at least if we
limit DTGs to their reachable values, which is reasonable).

As in Jonsson and Bäckström's work (jonsson-backstrom:amai98),
generated plans can be exponentially long, however, even though
Williams and Nayak do not discuss this. Therefore, the question
whether there exist polynomial-delay approximation algorithms for plan
generation with polynomially bounded performance ratio in this setting
remains open.

Idea: Work on this topic. The appropriate notions (polynomial delay
and polynomial bound on performance ratio) are interesting and extend
the standard approximation complexity notions which do not really
apply to exponentially-sized solutions. The questions have been
scratched by various people (Williams, Nayak, Jonsson, Bäckström,
Nebel), but never answered. The problems are interesting.

Discusses a problem which is very much like unary SAS+ planning, with
only a few, mostly unimportant differences (completely defined goal
state). The problem is called "STS" for "state-transition support";
the idea is that the state variables are agents, e.g. in a military
scenario, that require support from other agents to achieve some of
their state transitions (preconditions on operators that change the
value of that agent's variable).

The paper uses domain transition graphs (as "strategy graphs")
and causal graphs (as "dependence graphs") as central notions; it
analyses the complexity of the plan existence problem for various
causal graph shapes and some problem variants.

In the central problem considered by the authors, *all* transitions
must depend on *all* causal predecessors of that variable; this
requirement can be compiled away by "multiplying out" transitions iff
the causal graph indegrees are bounded. We call this the "fully
defined preconditions" (FDP) case.

The results are as follows:
* polynomial cases:
  - Causal graph is a chain with a constant number of variables
    (Obvious; the state space is polynomial then. This should extend
    to other causal graph shapes with a constant number of variables.)
  - The causal graph is a star with one high-level variable and n
    low-level variables (with FDP requirement).
* NP-complete cases:
  - Causal graph is a star with one high-level variable and n
    low-level variables (without FDP requirement).
  - Causal graph is a chain with two variables (in other words, any
    causal graph with any kind of dependency!) and the additional
    requirement that no variable may revisit the same value.
* intractable cases (exponentially long solutions):
  - Causal graph is a chain with an unbounded number of variables.
    The result already holds for variables with three-valued domains
    (it does *not* hold for binary domains, where the problem is
    NP-complete; cf. the result for singly connected DAGs in
    brafman-domshlak:jair-2003).

The authors also consider a variant where the set of *value sequences*
(rather than values) for each variable is polynomially bounded. In
this case, they get polynomiality for polytree causal graphs and
NP-completeness for singly connected DAG causal graphs.

Studies a subclass of SAS+ planning that allows for tractable plan
generation, named SAS+-IAO. The "IAO" restrictions are less strict
than the previously studied "PUS" restrictions (all PUS tasks are IAO
tasks), so this is a generalization of an earlier result.

The paper introduces domain transition graphs, and interestingly, the
IAO conditions are mostly about properties of domain transition graphs
(the "I" property requires "almost unariness" of the task). Unlike
other tractability results, the DTGs are mostly required to be
*sparse* (rather than, e.g., strongly connected); the intuition is
that non-undoable choices need not be backtracked if there is no
choice of operators.

The paper also contains a complete complexity map for plan generation
with the old SAS restrictions P, U, B and S and new restrictions I,
A-, A, A+, and O. (Plan *existence* is not studied; exponential length
shortest solution are enough evidence for a subclass to be "hard".)
Unlike the rest of the paper, the base formalism is "SAS*", not SAS+.
The difference is that the initial state may not contain unknown
values and there may not be postconditions without preconditions on
that variable. (This only makes a real difference compared to SAS+ in
the context of some of the restrictions.)

The complexity part shows that the IAO algorithm is actually optimal
(or can be made optimal) and can even be generalized to IA-O. It is
shown that IA-O is a unique maximal tractable subclass for optimal
planning in SAS*, and that the maximal tractable subclasses for
non-optimal planning in SAS* are IA-O and US (note that US implies IA
and A implies A-, so the main difference is the absence of O).

(Note on the lattice in Fig. 14: The lattice is somewhat misleading.
With regarded to optimal plan generation, it would seem from the
lattice that there are three maximal tractable subclasses:
PA, IA-O, and ISO. However, S implies A- (so that ISO implies IA-O),
P implies O, PA implies I and A implies A- (so that PA also implies
IA-O). Thus, IA-O is a unique maximal tractable subclass for optimal
plan generation. For non-optimal plan generation, the additional
maximal tractable subclass US is easily seen on the lattice.)

Extended version of jonsson-backstrom:amai98. Discusses a tractable
(for a given definition of "tractable", see below) fragment of
propositional STRIPS called "3S". The base formalism is STRIPS with
negation. The paper introduces causal graphs under the name
"dependency graphs", and using different kinds of arcs for different
kinds of dependency (negative preconditions, positive preconditions,
co-effects). (Knoblock is acknowledged for using the same concept
earlier in a more restricted form.)

The "3S" fragment is defined as follows:
* The dependency graph is acyclic (this implies unariness of
  operators).
* Every atom has one of the following three properties:
  - static: not used within an effect
    (or it is easy to prove that it should never change value, e.g. if
    it is initially true, needs to be true, and there are only deleting
    operators, no adding operators).
  - symmetrically reversible: For each operator that adds it there is
    an operator with identical preconditions that deletes it, and vice
    versa.
  - splitting: Removing the variable from the dependency graph
    disconnects the "positive precondition successors" from the
    "negative precondition successors", with respect to weak
    connectivity (i.e. disregarding arc directions).

Observe that symmetric reversibility of atoms is related to strong
connectivity of domain transition graphs. Splitting allows
partitioning a planning problem into several independent parts.

The 3S fragment has the following properties:
- Plan existence is polynomial.
- Bounded plan existence is NP-hard.
- Plan generation is intractable because there are problems with
  exponentially long solutions.
- There exists an incremental planning algorithm with polynomial
  delay, i.e., the algorithm decides plan existence in polynomial time
  and then generates a plan step by step, taking polynomial time
  between steps. However, the generated solution may be exponentially
  long even though polynomial solutions might exist, so this is not
  necessarily a polynomial approximation algorithm. (Jonsson and
  Bäckström do not give an example of this and only state that this
  problem might exist.)

Tenenberg defines abstractions as mappings from planning tasks to
planning tasks. The paper discusses two (actually, three) general
properties of abstractions of planning tasks, and gives examples for
them:

* Downward Solution Property: Every abstract solution is refinable
  through an operator-by-operator specialization to a concrete
  solution. "Operator by operator" actually means that every single
  abstract operator corresponds to a single concrete operator in the
  plan, so abstract operators are *not* "macro" operators. Example:
  Actions such as "slice mushroom with chef knife" and "dice ham with
  cleaver" are abstracted to "turn food to pieces".

  The example of an abstraction with that property is "inheritance
  abstraction", where specialized predicates such as "mushroom" and
  "meat" are generalized to abstract predicates like "food", and
  operators are generalized accordingly.

  Tenenberg gives a formal account of when inheritance abstraction
  satisfies the downward solution property; in general, it does not
  satisfy the upward solution property.

* Upward Solution Property: Whenever a concrete solution exists, there
  also exists an abstract solution.

  The example of an abstraction with that property is "abstraction
  with relaxed models", where several layered abstractions are
  produced by eliminating more and more predicates from consideration.

  Tenenberg shows how the predicates to eliminate may be chosen (the
  choice cannot be arbitrary in his formalism due to complications
  arising in the presence of domain axioms) and shows that this
  abstraction also satisfies the stricter "monotonicity property": The
  abstract plans can be refined to concrete plans by only inserting
  actions in certain locations, not removing or reordering any
  actions. (The set of actions in the original and abstract problems
  are identical.) This provides a formal background for earlier work
  on ABSTRIPS.

  Abstraction with relaxed models does not satisfy the downward
  solution property in general.

The authors provide a formal definition of "nonlinear" planning
problems. Nonlinear planning problems are planning problems with a set
of conjunctive goals such that no goal ordering is possible. "Goal
ordering" means committing to a certain total order on the set of
goals, such that goals appearing early in the order are subjected to
"goal protection": If we are in the state where the first K goals are
satisfied, we are not allowed to violate any of them. (We *are*,
however, allowed to violate goal K+2 even if it is satisfied, provided
that goal K+1 is not currently satisfied.

Planners that commit to a goal ordering and use goal protection are
called "linear planners". They cannot solve non-linear problems.

The authors formalize the notion by means of state transition graphs,
and in particular the subgraphs induced by the set of states in which
a given goal holds. Problems may arise if these subgraphs contain
several connected components, because then the planner may commit
itself to the "wrong" connected component and then never leave it due
to goal protection.

They provide two examples of such planning problems, one being
Sussman's anomaly in blocksworld, and the other being a robot motion
planning problem involving pushing a box and closing a door.

Notes:
- Korf:aij-1987 observes that the non-linearity in Sussman's anomaly
  depends on how exactly the goal is formalized; it goes away if
  having a certain block on the table is declared an explicit goal.
- "Non-linearity" is related to (the opposite of) Korf's notion of
  "serializability", although there are some differences. Korf goes
  further and defines serializability also for a set of subgoals,
  rather than all subgoals. In his words, "a set of subgoals [is]
  serializable if there exists an ordering among the subgoals such
  that the subgoals can always be solved sequentially without ever
  violating a previously solved subgoal in the order." (Korf:aij-1987,
  p. 71) One key difference here is the "always": later on, Korf makes
  it clear that he requires *all* subplans that satisfy the first
  goals to be extendable to the others, unlike Joslin and Roach: "In
  terms of our definition of a subgoal as a set of states, this means
  that for every state in a subgoal set, there exists a path into the
  next smaller subgoal set that lies entirely within the original
  subgoal set." (p.71).
- Joslin & Roach state that "a sufficient condition for goal ordering
  is that, for the given order, the subgraph for the conjunction of
  the first N + 1 subgoals is fully contained in the subgraph for the
  first N subgoals" (p. 104). This is clearly wrong; the subgraph for
  the *conjunction* will always be contained in the subgraphs for the
  conjuncts. So something else is probably meant.

Ideas:
- There are several possible notions of "linearity" or serializability
  that should probably be distinguished. (Apparently this is not done
  in the literature.) There are at least two different axes for
  classification here: whether or not *all* subgoal-achieving paths
  must be extendable to a subgoal-protecting, goal-achieving path
  (required by Korf, but not by Joslin & Roach), and whether the
  existence of *one* goal ordering is good enough (required by Korf
  and by Joslin & Roach) or *all* goal orderings should work. Problems
  for which *some* serialization exists might be called "weakly
  serializable", ones for which *any* serialization will do might be
  called "strongly serializable". Or maybe these terms are better used
  for the some path/all paths distinction. (Might be able to formalize
  this in LTL?)
- Both notions can be easily expressed through properties of (the
  intersections of) subgraphs induced by individual goals.
- Landmarks can probably also be integrated in this framework. (Have a
  look at Jörg's work?)
- There might be easily checkable sufficient criteria for (weak or
  strong) serializability in the SAS+ world that apply to some of the
  standard benchmarks.


on knoblock-abstractions:

This is the seminal work on the topic. It abstracts STRIPS-style
planning domains by removing certain literals from the domain (i.e.
from preconditions, effects, initial state and goal). A sequence of
such abstraction is called an abstraction hierarchy.

It introduces the "ordered monotonicity property" (OMP) (p. 246):
"For all abstract plans, all refinements of those plans leave the
literals established in the abstract space unchanged."
This does not guarantee that a given abstract plan can be refined, but
it does guarantee that if they can, then they can be refined in a
certain way. Knoblock formalizes what "refinement" is, his notion
capturing that mere replanning at each level of abstraction does not
constitute refinement.

Knoblock gives sufficient conditions for satisfying the OMP in a given
domain and in a task of a given domain. The former (Restriction 2.7,
p. 254) is equivalent to the condition that in no abstraction, there
is a path in the causal graph from a variable present in the
abstraction to a variable not present in the abstraction. The latter
(Restriction 2.10, p. 255) is roughly equivalent to the same property,
but only considering the subgraph of the causal graph that consists of
those variables from which goal variables can be reached.

Knoblock presents an algorithm for automatically creating an
abstraction hierarchy (Table 3, p. 259). This is very similar to Fast
Downward's approach: First generate the causal graph (Knoblock doesn't
give it a name, but it is the causal graph with the arc direction
reversed), then partition it into strongly connected components,
assigning a level in the hierarchy to each component, then order the
components according to a topological search of the graph. The
approach generates a perfect abstraction in (a certain formulation of)
Towers of Hanoi.

In addition to the "abstract" abstraction hierarchy generation
algorithm, Knoblock also presents ALPINE, a system for generating such
abstractions within a version of Prodigy modified to take into account
hierarchies. (This is basically depth-first search; the representation
language is STRIPS + axioms.) Knoblock shows that in two domains
(extended STRIPS robot motion planning and machine-shop scheduling)
Prodigy + ALPINE performs much better than Prodigy without ALPINE and
that it is better than or competitive to some other approaches to
improving Prodigy.

ALPINE differs from the abstract algorithm in that it makes use of
some extensions. These are to a major extent specific to the
representation (e.g. the distinction between "primary" and "secondary"
effects) and Prodigy's solution algorithm. For example, two of the
three enhancements for avoiding arcs in the causal graph ((1) and (3),
p. 268f) do not apply in Fast Downward's setting, the former because
it does not arise in a grounded representation, the latter because it
does not arise for unary operators.

A main difference is that ALPINE doesn't work on a fully grounded
representation (indeed, using such a representation is difficult in a
purely propositional setting), but instead groups together some
literals of the same predicate. (ALPINE doesn't group all literals of
the same predicate together, but makes distinctions based on type.)
This leads to some complications; e.g. in Towers of Hanoi,
abstractions can only be found if discs of different size are assumed
to be of different type.

However, there might be some generally exploitable ideas within
ALPINE's recursive construction of the causal graph (Table 7, p. 268)
as well. It would probably be a good idea to explicitly reformulate
the ordering constraints implicit in the algorithm. It should be
possible to do that by defining a notion of causal graph that uses arc
labels for different causalities (e.g. precondition to primary effect,
secondary effect to primary effect, etc.) and defines possible
abstractions in terms of properties of that graph.


on bacchus-downward-refinement:

The paper makes the following contributions:

* Bacchus & Yang define the "Downward Refinement Property" (DRP):
  "Every abstract solution can be refined to a concrete-level
  solution."

* They also analytically analyse the performance of depth-first
  refinement planning with abstraction hierarchies both in the
  presence of the DRP and in a relaxed setting where an abstract
  solution is only refinable to the next level with a certain
  probability p. They show that (under some assumptions, some of which
  are quite limiting) abstraction can exponentially reduce the running
  time. This is true both if the refinement probability is 1 and if it
  is very small (in which case abstraction can allow proving very
  quickly that no solution exists). The analysis is very well
  executed.

* They also provide an alternative ("semantic") definition of
  monotonic refinement which is less involved than Knoblock's and
  captures the idea of refinement equally well.

* They provide a new criterion for refinability called "k-ary
  necessary connectivity": Two levels of an abstraction hierarchy are
  "k-ary connected" iff for any two operators that can be applied in
  sequence in the higher level (i.e., it is possible for the
  preconditions of the second to be satisfied after the first is
  applied) and for which the second operator is made more concrete in
  the lower level, there must be a plan for reaching the preconditions
  of the second operator from the state where
  - *only* the preserved preconditions and effects of the first
    operator can be assumed to be true,
  - *no* variable of a higher level of abstraction is changed, and
  - the length of the plan is at most k.
  (Note that the second condition is related to the causal graph being
  acyclic.)

* Because the DRP is rarely satisfied in practice, they present the
  concept of "near-DRP" for hierarchies where the refinability
  probability from one level to the next is at least 0.5 and
  monotonically increases across levels.

* Algorithmically, the paper presents Highpoint, an extension of
  Alpine. Highpoint starts with a causal-graph like representation as
  used by Alpine (Knoblock's Restriction 2.7, which essentially
  defines inverted Causal Graphs, reappears as Definition 4.1), but
  instead of choosing an arbitrary topological sorting of that graph,
  Highpoint incorporates additional information.

  Because it respects the Causal Graph, Highpoint always generates
  hierarchies that satisfy the ordered monotonicity property. However,
  instead of choosing an arbitrary such hierarchy, breaking ties
  arbitrarily, it also tries to find a hierarchy that is "as near-DRP
  as possible". It does that by probabilistically estimating an
  approximation to k-ary connectedness. Moreover, it can *merge*
  connected components in the causal graph if the estimated
  refinability probability is too low.

  The experimental evaluation shows that Highpoint outperforms "plain
  Alpine" in a number of domains (robot motion planning, a computer
  domain, and machine-shop scheduling) in many cases, in particular
  when refinability probabilities are lowered below 1. The hierarchies
  are evaluated within the AbTweak planner.

Discusses the use of subgoals and macros for solving search problems.
Contributions include:
* Formalizations of subgoals as sets of states. Sequences of subgoals
  are considered as monotonically decreasing; in planning lingo,
  "subgoals" are conjunctions of individual goal literals with a
  growing number of conjuncts.
* The notion of "subgoal distance" as the maximal distance from a
  state in one subgoal to the nearest state in another. The effects of
  serial decomposition on runtime and solution length are analysed in
  terms of subgoal distance and search space diameter.
* The use and effect of abstractions, in particular abstractions using
  macro operators.
* Distinction between independent subgoals, serializable subgoals and
  non-serializable subgoals. A sequence of subgoals is serializable if
  for all states in all subgoals, the next subgoal is reachable
  without leaving the subgoal.
* Block-serializable subgoals: While individual subgoals may not be
  serializable, they may be partitioned into blocks that are. Korf
  gives a n^2-1 puzzle example.
* Pathological subgoals: Subgoals with the property that states within
  them have a *larger* average goal distance than random states. These
  do occur in Rubik's Cube; the question is if these subgoals are
  useful. They can still be useful because they limit the branching
  factor of the search.
* Macro actions: Korf discusses "total operator decomposability"
  (present in Rubik's cube) and "serial operator decomposability"
  (present in the Eight puzzle). Korf does not present an explicit
  operator model, but it looks like he assumes precondition-free
  operators which are defined by a set of conditional effects in a
  SAS-like formalism. He also seems to assume that the state space is
  "harmless", i.e., contains no dead ends.
  The decomposability properties are then the following:
  - Total decomposability:
    Every operator effect is of the form "v = d => v := d'", i.e.,
    only refers to the changed variable.
  - Serial decomposability:
    There is a total order among variables such that the condition of
    an effect changing v only refers to variables ordered before v
    (including v itself).
  Note how serial decomposability is related to acyclicity of causal
  graphs, if we do not include arcs between different effect variables
  of an operator. This kind of causal graph definition allows for a
  different kind of decomposition property than the stricter
  definition: For each goal state, there exists a set of |V|*|D| macro
  operators (where V are the variables and D is their domain) such
  that the problem can be solved only using these operators, from any
  state. (The idea is that there is one macro for setting v_1 to its
  goal value for any current value of v_1, one for setting v_2 to its
  goal value given that v_1 is initially at its goal value, etc.)
  Korf provides these macros for the 8-puzzle.
* Abstraction: Korf analyzes abstraction in general, showing how
  one level of abstraction can reduce the complexity of the problem to
  its square root, and how an optimal abstraction has ln N many levels
  (note that the natural logarithm is better than logarithms to other
  bases!). He also discusses the time/space trade-off of using
  abstractions.

}

The paper discusses planning in the Propositional STRIPS with Negation
(PSN) formalism restricted to unary operators. It uses causal graphs
as a central distinguishing criterion for subclasses of the problem,
and proves the following results:

* With arbitrary acyclic DAGs, minimal plans can be exponentially
  long. (The examples has a causal graph which is a total order.)
* Plan existence for acyclic, singly connected causal graphs is
  NP-complete (the NP membership proof in particular shows that plans
  cannot be exponentially long!). Hardness already holds for indegrees
  bounded by 6; for bounds lower than 6, the hardness question is
  open.
* In general, minimal plan length can be bounded by a function of the
  *number of paths* in the causal graph.
* For polytrees with bounded indegree, the authors present a
  polynomial planning algorithm.

Note: The problem for polytrees with unbounded indegree is open.

The authors also provide some results regarding the complexity of
planning with serializable subgoals. With acyclic causal graphs,
planning problems are always serializable, but determining the actual
serialization ordering can still be hard. Moreover, even when it is
known, planning can be difficult (e.g. due to exponentially long
solutions).

# Bibtex Repo

Before adding entries to any of the files in the bibliography
repository, please carefully read the instructions at the beginning
of `literatur.bib`!

If you add conference papers of conferences which are likely to be
cited multiple times, please add cross reference entries in both
`crossref.bib` and `crossref-short.bib`. See also the instructions at
the beginning of these files.

Usage: `\bibliography{abbrv,literatur,crossref}`
